# Bitmatrix-Spatial-Computing
BitMatrix Spatial Computing (BSC) is a groundbreaking framework that redefines traditional computational paradigms by introducing multidimensional data representation and processing. Unlike conventional binary systems, BitMatrix encodes information through spatial relationships, shapes, colors, perspectives, and temporal patterns.
