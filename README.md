# BitMatrix Spatial Computing

BitMatrix Spatial Computing (BSC) is a groundbreaking framework that redefines traditional computational paradigms by introducing multidimensional data representation and processing. Unlike conventional binary systems, BitMatrix encodes information through spatial relationships, shapes, colors, perspectives, and temporal patterns, resulting in significantly increased information density and computational flexibility.

Note: I have used ai to develop this project including parts of the website so apologies if it has hicups along the way. This is all experimental.

## Overview

BitMatrix Spatial Computing consists of three integrated components:

1. **3D/4D Computational Architecture**: This architecture forms the foundation of BitMatrix, enabling the representation of data in three or four dimensions. Each "bit" is transformed into a complex data structure with properties extending beyond simple binary values.

2. **Oen Agent System with Expandable Toolkit**: Serving as the operational layer, this system leverages the multidimensional architecture through specialized algorithms and adaptive behaviors, facilitating efficient data processing and analysis.

3. **5D Kinetic Transform Arithmetic (KTA)**: Extending the mathematical framework of BitMatrix, KTA enables operations inspired by quantum computing principles without the need for specialized quantum hardware.

## Features

- **Enhanced Data Compression**: By utilizing multidimensional encoding, BitMatrix achieves higher information density, leading to more efficient data storage.
- **Advanced Error Correction**: The spatial relationships within the BitMatrix architecture allow for more robust error detection and correction mechanisms.
- **Improved Pattern Recognition**: Leveraging complex data structures and spatial encoding enhances the system's ability to recognize and interpret patterns within data.
- **Quantum-Inspired Computing**: Implements virtual representations of quantum-inspired operations such as superposition and entanglement without requiring specialized hardware.
- **Lightweight Implementation**: Designed to be efficient and performant even on modest hardware.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install bitmatrix-spatial-computing
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitmatrix-spatial-computing.git
cd bitmatrix-spatial-computing
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import bsc

# Create a 3D bitfield
bitfield = bsc.BitField3D(8, 8, 4)

# Set some bits
bitfield.setBit(0, 0, 0, 1)
bitfield.setBit(7, 7, 3, 1)

# Set properties
bitfield.setProperty(0, 0, 0, "color", "red")

# Visualize the bitfield
print(bsc.visualize3D(bitfield))

# Apply a transformation
rotated = bsc.rotate3D(bitfield, 'z', 90)
print(bsc.visualize3D(rotated))
```

### Generate Patterns

```python
import bsc

# Generate a cube pattern
cube = bsc.generatePattern('cube', (8, 8, 4))
print(bsc.visualize3D(cube))

# Generate a 4D wave pattern
wave = bsc.generatePattern('wave', (8, 8, 4, 2))
print(bsc.visualize4D(wave))
```

### Apply KTA Operations

```python
import bsc

# Create two bitfields
bitfield_a = bsc.generatePattern('cube', (8, 8, 4))
bitfield_b = bsc.generatePattern('sphere', (8, 8, 4))

# Create a superposition
superposition = bsc.superposition(bitfield_a, bitfield_b)
print(bsc.visualize3D(superposition))

# Apply a kinetic transform
transformed = bsc.applyKineticTransform(bitfield_a, 'wave')
print(bsc.visualize3D(transformed))
```

## Command-Line Interface

BitMatrix Spatial Computing includes a command-line interface for quick experimentation:

```bash
# Create a 3D bitfield with a cube pattern
python -m bsc.cli create 8 8 4 --pattern cube --visualize

# Apply a rotation transformation
python -m bsc.cli transform rotate --axis z --angle 90

# Generate a pattern
python -m bsc.cli pattern wave 8 8 4

# Animate a transformation
python -m bsc.cli animate --pattern-type cube --frames 5
```

## Web Demo

A simple web demo is included in the `examples/web_demo` directory. To run it:

```bash
cd examples/web_demo
python -m http.server
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8000` to interact with the demo.
